### Add a Local Printer:

2. Open the Settings app from the Start menu.
3. Click Devices.
4. Click Add a printer or scanner.
5. If Windows detects your printer, click on the name of the printer and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the installation. And you're done.
6. If Windows doesn't find your connected printer, click on **"The printer that I want isn't listed"** link.
7. Then let the Windows troubleshooting guide help you find your printer. It will search for available printers and help you download the drivers for them.
8. If that doesn't work, head to your printer manufacturer's website and download the drivers and installation tools for your printer.

### Add a Wireless Printer:

**_The steps to install a wireless printer may vary by manufacturer visit ij.start.cànon to know more. In general, however, modern printers today will detect your network and automate the installation._**

1. Use the printer's LCD panel to enter the wireless setup. On cànon printer this is under Setup > Wireless LAN Settings.
2. Select your Wi-Fi network. You'll need to know your home network's SSID, which you can find by hovering your mouse over the Wi-Fi icon in the taskbar.
3. Enter your network password.
4. In some cases, you might need to temporarily connect your printer to your computer via USB to install software. But otherwise, that's it.
5. You should find your printer automatically added in the Printers & scanners section under Settings > Devices.


### Add a Shared Printer:

1. Windows home networking feature called HomeGroup automatically shares printers and certain files with other computers on your home network. Here we'll set up a HomeGroup, if you don't already have one set up, and connect to the shared printer.
2. If a client user opens the printer driver properties (to display the properties when using Windows 7, press the Alt key, and select [Printer properties] from the displayed [File] menu) and then clicks [OK] with the [Enable bidirectional support] check box cleared on the [Ports] tab, the bidirectional communication function of the printer server may also be disabled.
